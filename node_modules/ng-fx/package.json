This is the core and foundation, but there is room for so much more. You can use these css animations dynamically with zero setup. So you get the best of both worlds (css vs js animations). Take a look and enjoy.\n\n# Getting started\n\n## Installing\n**ng-fx requires `ngAnimate >=1.4`.** Previous versions of ng-fx `<2.0` support earlier versions of `ngAnimate`, but dev support is lacking there. If you would love to help maintain, let me know!\n\nThere are two ways to install ng-fx\nusing `bower`\n  * `bower install --save ng-fx`\n``` html\n  <script src=\"bower_components/ng-fx/ng-fx.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"bower_components/angular-animate/angular-animate.min.js\"></script>\n```\n``` javascript\n  angular.module('app', ['ng-fx', 'ngAnimate'])\n```\nusing `npm`\n  * `npm i --save ng-fx`\n``` javascript\n  angular.module('app', [\n    require('ng-fx'),\n    require('angular-animate')\n  ])\n```\n\n## Using animations\nng-fx makes it so simple to use animations by tying into `ngAnimate` and [all the hooks]('https://code.angularjs.org/1.4.7/docs/guide/animations') it provides.\n\n### First animation\nAfter installing ng-fx, using the animations are as easy as declaring css classes on elements.\n```html\n<div ng-if=\"show\" class=\"fx-fade-normal\"></div>\n```\nFew things happening here. First, we must tie into animations from `ngAnimate`, in this case we're attaching an animation to the `enter` and `leave` hooks of `ng-if`. Next we declare the animation type by using the `fx` namespace followed by the animation name (`fx-fade-normal`). Place this in the class of the element. That's it. ng-fx has an api to adjust the animations' speed, ease, and to stagger or not. Here's a list of all the [animations ng-fx supports](https://github.com/angularclass/ngFx/blob/master/animationList.txt)\n\n### Adjusting speed\nng-fx looks like innocent css animations. They are ran like css animations (performance!!!) but they are indeed dynamic like js animations as well. Here's how we can adjust the speed of an animation.\n```html\n<div ng-show=\"error\" class=\"fx-fade-up fx-speed-342\"></div>\n```\n\nUsing the `fx-[speed | dur | duration]-{any num in ms}` we can control the speed of said animation. So the following are all equivalent.\n* `fx-speed-230`\n* `fx-dur-230`\n* `fx-duration-230`\n\n### Adjusting the ease\n```html\n<div\n  ng-repeat=\"card in cards\"\n  class=\"fx-fade-up fx-ease-sine\">\n</div>\n```\nUsing `fx-ease-{curve name}` will apply the given curve to the animation. Here is a list of all the [curves ng-fx supports](https://github.com/angularclass/ngFx/blob/master/easingList.txt)\n\n### Staggering\nWith `ngAnimate` 1.4, we now have support for staggering outside of css animations.\n\n```html\n<div\n  ng-repeat=\"card in cards\"\n  class=\"fx-rotate-up-left fx-stagger-245\">\n</div>\n```\n\nUsing `fx-stagger-{delay in ms}` on an animation in `ng-repeat` will stagger those elements with the given delay in between.\n\n### Contributing\nAll help is welcome! ng-fx is an ongoing and live project. If you'd like to add more animations or support new feature, open an issue and even submit it yourself. If you're new to open source, I'll help you get your first commit in, ping me. To get started make sure you have...\n\n* `node >=0.12`\n* `gulp`\n* `webpack`\n\nIf you're good there, then...\n\n* `fork`\n* `clone` your fork\n* cut a new branch\n* `npm install`\n* `npm start`\n\nThis will compile and build the project. ng-fx uses `ES2015`, `webpack`, and `gulp`, nothing else too fancy here.\n\nThere is a demo app to try out the animations.\n\nMost the commands you'll need are baked into `npm`\n* `npm run build`\n  * builds and outputs regular and min src code\n* `npm test`\n  * run test\n* `npm start`\n  * run build and watch for changes to rebuild, launches the demo app and refreshes that on change.\n\nSome helpful commands in gulp\n\n* `gulp animation --name animation-name`\n  * call this command with a new animation name and it will create all the boilerplate in the `src/animation/element/` that you need to get started with a new animation.\n  \nWe use ,*cough*, try to use the [angular contributing guidelines]('https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit')\n",
